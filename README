Some files for the MOHAI Maker Day project I'm running
on Feb 20. The idea is that kids can get a plastic medallion
of any color they want starting from a drawing they make on
a sheet of paper. This software converts that drawing into a
3D STL file, which I'll print, make a silicone mold from, and
then let them cast in resin they can color themselves.
